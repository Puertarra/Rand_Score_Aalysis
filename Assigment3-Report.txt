Report:

The project consisted of running the unparameterized versions of the K-Means and AgglomerativeClustering (CLAN) algorithms on the project dataset. A k=4 was used as the clustering hyper-parameter.

The results where:

Rand Index for K-Means:  0.4352
Rand Index for CLAN:  0.4405

The reported Rand Index for both K-Means and CLAN, standing at 0.4319 and 0.4405 respectively, suggests a measure of similarity between the cluster assignments produced by these algorithms and the ground truth, which has just two classes. Considering that both algorithms were configured with a predetermined cluster count k=4 and subjected to the default parameter adjustments, even though the actual data is categorized into merely two classes, the CLAN algorithm shows a slightly more aligned result with the true classification compared to K-Means. The Rand Index scores indicate that while neither clustering perfectly aligns with the true labels, CLAN's approach results in a grouping that is slightly  more congruent with the actual class distribution, highlighting its relative efficacy in dealing with this dataset's specific clustering challenge.

Two additional experiments were conducted aiming for improved indices. These experiments demonstrate the value of more sophisticated hyper-parameter selection in both algorithms.
